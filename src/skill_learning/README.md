## About tutorials

Many experienced people in your field cannot teach you HOW TO something, they have built a nuanced complex understanding of the skill, a mental model of the skill that will either not make . 

Because their model is nuanced some of sensations they feel will be diffiult or impossible to translate into language. Understanding of that nuanced model without getting first hand experience is very difficult. Some of the hints dont even make sense unless you experienced more basic simplified versions of the skill and internalize the promlems with it. When problems are clear it is easier to search for a solution.

Because their model is complex, a big part of it is engrained in the subconcious main through years of practice. Even if you understand that model, trying to apply it only relying on the attention and control through the concious mind will be simply too much.


What they can teach you, is how did they practice that particular skill and how the evolution of their practice has been as the skill level grew. Not many experts put effort to keep in memory all the small breakthroughs in their skill development. So if you find the ones that have payed attention to how they got there, you are in a good place. 

Alternatively, get your own first hand experience and note your errors. Observe what experts do differently, select just a few components on the skill, study the execution that you would like to learn and go back to deliberately practice that specific thing. New experience will both yield progress but more importantly unlock new nuanced questions, new focus points that you can search for in order to complete your mental model of the trick.
